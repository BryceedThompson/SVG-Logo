# SVG-Logo


## Description
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. Theres not much more to it, using the command line can be a little dificult if someone is new to it so rememver to. us 'npm i' to install in the terminal for the 'index.js' file and 'npm start' to initiate the prompt.
